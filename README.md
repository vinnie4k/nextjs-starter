## Project Structure

This project uses App Router by Next.js which uses a file-based routing system within the `app` directory. Routes can be created by making new directories inside of the `app` folder with a `page.tsx` file.

- **public**: Houses static assets like images and fonts. Files here are accessible directly from the root of the web server.

- **src**: Where the main source code resides.
  - **app**: Used with Next.js's App Router, containing the application's layouts, pages, and potentially other components.
  - **components**: Reusable UI elements are typically stored here. These are the building blocks of the application's visual interface.
  - **icons**: Contains SVG files used as icons throughout the app.
  - **models**: Contains TypeScript interfaces, types, and other data structures to represent data models.
  - **services**: Houses code that interacts with external APIs or handles business logic related to data fetching, manipulation, or other asynchronous operations.
  - **stores**: Stores global state management logic with Zustand.
  - **utils**: General-purpose utility functions, helper code, and constants that can be reused across different parts of the application.

## Application Logic

Zustand is used for global client-side state management. For global server-side state management, used TanStack Query. API calls should be made with Axios.
